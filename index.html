                    <h3> Heartbreak </h3>
                    <p>
                        Do you know the feeling of heartbreak? <br>
                        I think it’s improperly named <br>
                        I gave you a piece of my heart but you didn’t shatter it<br>
                        You just handed it back saying you didn’t want to carry around the weight anymore<br>
                        <br>
                        It returned to me with an imprint of your finger<br>
                        Making a small dent that was somehow big enough <br>
                        to prevent the piece from fitting back into my heart <br>
                        I had to sew it back in with strings of memories I cherish but need to let go of <br>
                        <br>
                        But despite the stitches my heart didn’t ache <br>
                        Without you stone cold,<br>
                        it plummeted into my stomach<br>
                        the impact crushing my hopes and appetite <br>
                        The crash twisted my intestines like the butterflies used to do when I saw you <br>
                        Except this time you weren't there to release them into the open air <br>
                        <br>
                        A heartbreak doesn’t tear you from the inside out, <br>
                        it slowly breaks you from outside in. <br>
                        It manifests in the unconscious arm twitches <br>
                        reaching out toward you when you’re not there<br>
                        The pain spreads to the shoulders <br>
                        making me feel like I am carrying a weight heavy enought to break my spine. <br>
                        The pain shows itself in the white flashing heachaches <br>
                        where my brain tries to remember something I so fiercely am trying to forget. <br>
                        <br>
                        But my heart is still in its ice cold capsule <br>
                        stubbornly refusing to feel a thing <br>
                        A heartache cripples everything but the heart <br>
                        <br>
                        Do you know the feeling of heartbreak?

                        gave it to you <br>
                        then stole it back<br>
                        trying to shove the bleeding muscle<br>

                    <p>
                        after being scattered <br>
                        i picked up the pierces<br>
                        and sewed myself <br>
                        stick by stitch <br>
                        back together <br>

                        after being blown to bits <br>
                        the shrapnel is now infused in me<br>
                        and i welded myself <br>
                        burning and bleeding <br>
                        back together 

                        now that’s it’s over <br>
                        i’m stronger <br>
                        but i could <br>
                        never <br>
                        do it <br>
                        again <br>

                        treat me the way you did <br>
                        for so long <br>

                        i can’t trust my judgment anymore <br>
                        because for two years i judged you <br>
                        to be innocent of any wrong <br>
                        and myself to be guilty <br>
                        of not being who you wanted me to be <br>

                        i’m terrified <br>
                        of loving again <br>
                        because when i was with you <br>
                        i hated who i became <br>
                        i don’t want<br>
                        to hate myself again<br>
                        in order to love someone else <br>

                        it’s my fault <br>
                        that you love someone who does not exist <br>
                        because i became the person <br>
                        you’ve always wanted <br>
                        but that person wasn’t me <br>
                        <br>
                        i look back on the time <br>
                        we were together <br>
                        and i remember the girl <br>
                        who was strong <br>
                        but around you i turned weak <br>
                        not weak in the knees like the fairy tales <br>
                        just weak <br>
                        <br>
                        i hate the weak girl <br>
                        who you knew <br>
                        she wasn’t real <br>
                        you created her in your mind <br>
                        and i just followed the code <br>
                        she was a slave to your love <br>
                        because she never knew someone could love<br>
                        the idea of her <br>
                        so much <br>

                        i can tell what you want me to say<br>
                        and it would be so easy <br>
                        to whisper those words 
                        into your ear <br>
                        to act like your marionette <br>
                        doing what you want me to<br>

                        you would love your doll<br>
                        pamper her <br>
                        she’s created in your image <br>
                        she’s created in your imagination <br>

                        i can see the string you want to pull <br>
                        would it be so bad <br>
                        to just let you <br>
                        mold me into someone who <br>

                        and meant more than just that<br>
                        i didn’t know there was so much more<br>
                        than i love you <br>

                        so that my head fits perfectly into the crook of your neck <br>
                        your stomach fits the curve of my back <br>

                        i thought that was a task saved only for gods <br>
                        your strength comparable to titans<br>
                        Atlas condemned but you think it’s a blessing <br>
                        to hold mine in you hands <br>
                        i never knew <br>
                        one person could hold so much of me <br>
                        in their mind <br>
                        that they keep memories of the smallest things i like <br>
                        where they could listen to the same story i've already told twice <br>
                        and ask me to tell it again just to keep hearing my voice <br>
                        i never knew there would exist a man <br>
                        who could hold me in his arms <br>
                        tell me that i’m caring <br>
                        show me that i’m strong <br>

                    <h3>The Greatest Poets</h3>
                    <p>
                        our love makes the great poets look dim <br>
                        the love they speak of is merely infatuation <br>
                        the poets speak of beauty<br>
                        but the ugly parts of us are the strongest <br>
                        we burned for each other but the skin healed and now the scars and bruises are just reminders of
                        how hard we fell for each other <br>
                        the poets speak of youth<br>
                        but i’m in love with the wrinkles that will appear on your face decades from now<br>
                        as our youth fades <br>
                        our love will only age,<br>
                        the poets eat grapes from a vine in their cloth but we let it sit, wine dripping from our
                        lips<br>
                        we taste just how sweet it can become <br>
                        together all the tannins blossomed into memories of the life we shared with <br>
                        when the wall paper starts chipping we will peel back revealing the mural painted on the wall a
                        map of all the places we’ve been each a story we have told a thousand times but could tell a
                        thousand more <br>
                        the poets speak of radiance<br>
                        but the golden eye of heaven was created from your smile and the heat from the way you look at
                        me and the twinkle from your laugh and<br>
                        they weren’t fortunate enough to hear it<br>
                        the greatest poets know nothing <br>
                        of me and you

                        the buzz of the screen <br>
                        the light casting a perfect shadow on your profile <br>
                        it’s your hand in mine <br>
                        and the smell of your shirt <br>
                        your nose buried in my hair as you breathe me in <br>
                        it’s in the way that your eye crease <br>
                        and the way i can finally breathe deep <br>
                        when i sigh into your shoulder and all the knots dissolve <br>
                        i don’t have to say <br>
                        what it is <br>
                        i know you know <br>

                    <h3> The Puppeteer</h3>
                    <p>
                        In my eyes I am dancing on two crossed wooden beams <br>
                        the sheer strings catch the light ever so perfectly that to me it seems <br>
                        Like they shimmer, begging to be pulled <br>
                        If temptation was a virtue, i would be made of gold <br>
                        <br>
                        The light reflects your secrets, a tapestry of stories <br>
                        I know how to make you smile and smooth away your worries <br>
                        I can see who you want me to be <br>
                        And I could become her so easily <br>
                        The girl you desire, the one you dream of <br>
                        Would it be so bad if I just let you mold me into someone who you love? <br>
                        <br>
                        She's happy all the time, and shiny and new <br>
                        she says all the right things at the right time and I would love her too <br>
                        Shes made in your image <br>
                        Shes made in your imagination <br>
                        Because the girl you dreamed of is just a figmentation <br>
                        So now who’s to blame? when the girl you love doesn't exist <br>
                        You wanted me to be someone who I’m not, and I couldn’t resist <br>
                        So did I play you or were you using me, <br>
                        Maybe we were both filling voids we didn’t know were that deep <br>
                        I just wanted to make you happy and now we are both in tears <br>
                        But who do you cry to when you’re your own puppeteer? <br>

                    <h3>Greed</h3>
                    <p>
                        if you strip me down past the bare bones <br>
                        take away the physical and go straight for the soul<br>
                        if you wash clear the fog of memories <br>
                        you would be left with pure desire and need <br>
                        <br>
                        I think maybe in another life i was happy just being happy but I can't picture that for me <br>
                        There's a craving inside that i'm in love with <br>
                        like content is a cage that I must break free <br>
                        Because what am I without the yearning, the hope to be more?<br>
                        I think I would go crazy behind white picket fences and closed doors. <br>
                        <br>
                        They say greed is a sin but Id choose it over sloth<br>
                        if I'm going to be a sinner i want to have the whole lot <br>
                        give me everything from happiness to the pain <br>
                        give me more than i can take, give me the credit and the blame<br>
                        <br>
                        maybe it will finally satiate me <br>
                        when i’ve run the world ragged, taken all the green <br>
                        when i’ve experience everything in my short little life <br>
                        when i can say i know everything but can’t remember the price <br>
                        <br>
                        maybe it’s who i am <br>
                        or who i need to be <br>
                        so that i can feel like i'm alive <br>
                        because what am i without the greed? <br>
